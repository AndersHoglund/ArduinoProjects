Arduino input pins and function:

Data input Can bee used with either:
Alt 1: PWM (Servo type signal from any Rx output).
or  2: Serial RX input (Spektrum Serial RX signal from a DSMx remote reciever).
Depending if code is compiled with USE_PWM_INPUT or USE_SERIAL_RX_INPUT defined.

Input connections via for example a std servo cable:
A0,  Data signal input. PWM or Serial.
+5V Power from main Rx or BEC
GND

If a remote serial Rx is used, it may need 3.3v depending on type. Either from the Arduino, or its own regulator built into the cable.

One practical way of connecting the LEDs are to take a 90 degree angled 2x12 pin header. Solder a wire 
across all top pins and cut off the 90 degree angle, thus creating a gnd rail on the upper pins. 
Remaining lower 90 degreee angled pins are soldered onto the Arduino Nano output holes D2 - D12. 
Pin 13 will end up in the mounting hole in the corner. D13 output are on the opposite side and needs 
a short wire over to pin 13 in the header. 
Connect the ground rail wire to the GND hole close to D2 on the Arduino Nano. 

A box for the LED controller can be 3D-printed using STL files in "RC LED Controller Box.zip".
