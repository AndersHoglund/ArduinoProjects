Arduino input pins and function:

Data input Can bee used with either:
Alt 1: PWM (Servo type signal from any Rx output).
or  2: Serial RX input (Spektrum Serial RX signal from a DSMx remote reciever).
or  3: SRXL2 input from a master Rx
Depending if code is compiled with USE_PWM_INPUT, USE_SERIAL_RX_INPUT or USE_SRXL2_INPUT defined.

Input connections via for example a std servo cable:
A0,  Data signal input. PWM or SerialRx.
+5V Power from main Rx or BEC
GND

If a remote serial Rx is used, it may need 3.3v depending on type. Either from the Arduino, or its own regulator built into the cable. 

SRXL2 is connected to the Nano RX0 and via a zener diode to TX1, +5V and GND. Use the Bind/Prog/SRXL2 port on the Rx

  7     D8, POS_LIGHT,     1300           White
  8     D9, BEACON,        -              Red slow fading beacon. allways on when powered
  9    D10, BEACON,        1200           Red belly fading beacon, slightly faster.
 10    D11, LANDING_LIGHT, 1500           White landing lights
 11    D12, LANDING_LIGHT, 1500           White landing lights
 12    D13, BACKUP_LIGHT,  1700           White backup/reverse lights

The PWM timing intervals in sequnce:
1000 - 1199 all off except beacon on D9, power on indicator.
1200 - 1299 Beacon on D10, plus above.
1300 - 1399 Position lights, plus all above.
1400 - 1499 ACL strobes, plus all above.
1500 - 1699 Landing lights, plus all above.
1700 - 2000 Backup/reverse lights, plus all above.

Set PWM pulse width for each position the Tx switch you want to use, to select what lights comes on or off.
With a 6 position switch, like the S1 - S6 push buttons on TX16s, you have full control of each step.
With only a two or three position switch, you have to choose what ligths come on and off in each position.


One practical way of connecting the LEDs are to take a 90 degree angled 2x12 pin header. Solder a wire 
across all top pins and cut off the 90 degree angle, thus creating a gnd rail on the upper pins. 
Remaining lower 90 degreee angled pins are soldered onto the Arduino Nano output holes D2 - D12. 
Pin 12 will end up in the mounting hole in the corner. D13 output are on the opposite side and needs 
a short wire over to pin 12 in the header. 
Connect the ground rail wire to the GND hole close to D2 on the Arduino Nano.

LEDs will need serial resistors built into their cableing, 100 ohms or so for std bright LEDS. Be sure to stay at 15-20mA each. Arduino outputs can take 40mA, but give it some headroom if you use many LEDs. If you need more juice, you will need to built external power buffers.

A box for the LED controller can be 3D-printed using STL files in "RC LED Controller Box.zip".
